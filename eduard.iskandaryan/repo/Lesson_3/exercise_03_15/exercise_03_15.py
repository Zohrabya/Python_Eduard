State the order of evaluation of the operators in each of the following Python statements and show the value of x after each statement is performed.

a.	x = 7 + 3 * 6 / 2 - 1

1. 6 / 2
2. 3 * (6 / 2)
3. 7 + (3 * (6 / 2))
4. (7 + (3 * (6 / 2))) - 1
x = 15

b.	x = 2 % 2 + 2 * 2 - 2 / 2

1. 2 % 2 
2. (2 % 2) + (2 * 2)
3. ((2 % 2) + (2 * 2) - (2 / 2))
x = 3

c.	x = ( 3 * 9 * ( 3 + ( 9 * 3 / ( 3 ) ) ) )

1. 3 / (3)
2. 9 * (3 / (3))
3. 3 + (9 * (3 / (3)))
4. 9 * (3 + (9 * (3 / (3))))
5. 3 * (9 * (3 + (9 * (3 / (3)))))
x = 324
